# Raspberry Cat Feeder

## An automatic cat feeder   

Raspberry Cat Feeder is a an automatic cat feeder powered by [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/ "raspberrypi.com").  The [rcf] can be programmed to feed at prescribed intervals or on demand through a web interface.  

Design goals for the project include:
- assembled from inexpensive, commonly accessible hardware using simple hand tools available to the average DIYer.
- provide food for extended away intervals
- be reliable and low maintenance
- be rodent and vermin "*proof* "


## Mechanical

## Circuit Diagram

A circuit diagram is shown below as well as a list of the major components used in the prototype version built.  The selection of these components was strictly based on parts available on hand at the time.

N.B. some of these relay modules may behave differently. Caution should be exercised - transistor driver circuits and or pull up/down resistors may
be required to ensure reliable relay operation and or damage to the pi.
